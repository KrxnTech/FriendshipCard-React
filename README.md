GOOD FRIENDS CARD REACT MINI PROJECT
---
This project is a simple user interface card built using React JS as a first hands on experience with the library. The objective was to understand how React works at a fundamental level by building a complete component instead of only learning concepts theoretically.

The card displays a short friendship themed message using a clean layout soft colors and structured JSX. The project focuses on understanding component structure JSX syntax and basic styling rather than advanced React features.

PURPOSE
---
The purpose of this project was to gain practical exposure to React fundamentals and understand how a React application is structured in a real environment. Building this project helped convert theoretical knowledge into working code.

WORKING
---
The application starts from main jsx where React is mounted into the root HTML file. The App component acts as the main container and imports individual components such as Base Heading and PinkPage. Each component is responsible for a specific part of the user interface and has its own CSS file for styling.

JSX is used to write UI markup and components are combined to form the final card layout.

WHAT I LEARNED
---
Through this project I learned how React applications are structured how JSX differs from traditional HTML and how components are created imported and styled. I also gained clarity on file organization and the role of entry files in a React project.

This project helped build confidence to move forward with props state and more advanced React concepts.
